#### Quick Introduction
ProtoString is a project that aims to expand upon the methods available in the native String object of JavaScript, by creating a library of methods that you can use as a whole or in snippets. By default, the methods provided are an extenstion of ``String.prototype``, they can however, be easily modified to be functional if preferred. For more information, please check out the [ProtoString Wiki](https://github.com/SethClydesdale/protostring/wiki) as it contains a bunch of information and documentation on this project.
