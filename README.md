ProtoString is a project that aims to expand upon the methods available in the native String object of JavaScript, by creating a library of methods that you can use as a whole or in snippets. New methods and updates are being added day by day to keep the library fresh, and expand the amount of methods at your disposal.

For more information on the project, I recommend that you check out the wiki, as it includes a number of examples and information on the project. The wiki is constantly updated to keep up to date with all changes made to the library, so you can always find information on new methods and updates to exisiting ones.
